                <h3>Bea Alonzo, Dominic Roque confirm 'end' of engagement</h3>
                <p>Actors Bea Alonzo and Dominic Roque confirmed Sunday that they have ended their engagement, 
                    putting to rest weeks of rumors surrounding the pair's relationship status.
                    In a statement posted jointly on their Instagram accounts, Alonzo and Roque said the split was a mutual decision.
                    "After much thought, consideration, and care, we have mutually decided to amicably end our engagement. It was not an easy decision," the two said. 
                
                    "Some even confirmed our break-up without our consent and some created ridiculous stories that had no basis and were utterly false,
                    so we felt the need to share this announcement with great sadness, for our peace of mind and our families," they said.
                    Both Alonzo and Roque asked the public for privacy and to "kindly spare us from more cruel and very hurtful words thrown on social media." </p>

                <h3>Pop icon Bruno Mars to perform in Bangkok in March</h3>
                <p>GBANGKOK: Bruno Mars will be returning to Thailand for his first concert in six years. The concert, titled "Bruno Mars Live in Bangkok," 
                    will be held on Saturday, March 30 at Rajamangala Stadium. The American singer-songwriter will perform at Rajamangala National Stadium on March 30, 2024 
                    with tickets ranging from 2,000 to 11,000 baht. Pre-sale tickets will go on sale online from 10am on January 25, while the public round will start the day after.
                    Last week, the promoter confirmed that Mars will return to Bangkok and Singapore after almost six years. The announcement came as he kicked off his concert residency in Tokyo,
                     where he covered “Heavy Rotation” of the Japanese girl group AKB48.The concert will be the third time he plays in Bangkok after his first live gig in 2014 on his
                      “Moonshine Jungle Tour” and again in 2018 as part of the “24K Magic World Tour.”</p>

                <h3>K-pop group ENHYPEN on touring, Pinoy fans, 2024 plans</h3>
                <p>MANILA — When ENHYPEN held a concert in the Philippines last February 2023, the fast-rising K-pop group played three nights at 
                    a packed Mall of Asia Arena for its “Manifesto” tour — a testament to the seven-piece act’s popularity in the country.Exactly a year later, 
                    the septet returned for its second “Fate” tour. And while the group only performed for one night, 
                    ENHYPEN managed to draw tens of thousands of fans to the bigger New Clark City Stadium in Tarlac, about a two-hour drive away from Manila.
                    In just over three years, the septet has managed to become a commercial success. Its most recent EP “Orange Blood,” for instance, 
                    reportedly sold over 1.87 million copies in its first week and became the group’s fourth “million-selling” album. 

                    ENHYPEN has also embarked on two world tours, playing in big venues such as the Tokyo Dome and Kyocera Dome in Japan.
                
                    At a press conference during their first visit to Manila in late 2022, the members shared that being on tour helps them improve as performers.
                    For the second “Fate” tour, Jungwon said, “We’re back here as a more mature ENHYPEN.”</p>

                <h3> Kathryn Bernado's contract signing</h3>
                <p> Amid the happy occasion of her contract renewal with ABS-CBN on Feb. 2, Kathryn Bernardo broke down in tears 
                    as she reflected on her journey as a Kapamilya and looked back on the hurdles she faced in 2023. ABS-CBN held a grand contract signing event 
                    last February 2 hosted by fellow Kapamilya star Dimples Romana where Kathryn expressed her love and gratitude for the network.
                    The network's president and CEO Carlo Katigbak responded by calling the actress a superstar, "You have an amazing talent on screen and it shows in the success in everything that you do but more than that,
                    I have been witness to your most special trait — it's the kindness and the grace that you showed to the people around you."
                    Kathryn's mother had previously denied a rumored move to GMA Network following Kathryn's breakup with longtime partner Daniel Padilla, 
                    who is also renewing his contract with Star Magic.</p>

                <h3>Daniel Padilla thanks Kathryn Bernardo at contract signing with ABS-CBN</h3>
                <p> Daniel Padilla is navigating his life and career as a single person, but said that he would never forget the good times that 
                    he shared with his ex-girlfriend, Kathryn Bernardo. At the contract renewal signing ceremony with ABS-CBN’s Star Magic held last Feb. 12, 
                    Padilla thanked his family, loved ones, and ABS-CBN’s executives, but his most touching tribute was for Bernardo, who he had been with for 11 years.
                    "I will never forget Kathryn. Thank you very much for the many years we spent together. The memories, adventures, and journeys we shared will never be forgotten in my heart. 
                    Thank you very much." he said. At present, Padilla said he just wants to live in the present, while minding his own business. Asked about his immediate plans, he said: “I wanna spend time with my family, enjoying life, 
                    and minding our own business.
                    I [also want to spend time with my friends. I want to enjoy and soak in life. I want to focus on my work and life.”Padilla is set to star in the upcoming films “The Guest” and “Nang Mapagod Si Kamatayan,” 
                    although details about its storyline and premiere dates have yet to be disclosed.

                    He was supposed to star in a reunion film with Bernardo as well. However, it remains unknown whether the project would push through, or will be shelved for good.</p>
