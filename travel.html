                <h3>Padre Pio shrine in Batangas aims for int'l shrine status</h3>
                <p>MANILA – The National Shrine of Saint Padre Pio in Sto. Tomas, Batangas is looking to attain the status of an international shrine.</p>
                <p> The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) news website on Tuesday reported that the national shrine is aspiring for such stature, 
                    according to a book titled “Enlarging the Space of our Tent”, published by the Archdiocese of Lipa released on Jan. 13.
                    The Vatican approves the designation of an international shrine, which classifies it as a sacred place for divine worship for the universal Church.</p>
                <p> It was established in 2003 and declared as an archdiocesan shrine five years later. In 2015, it was recognized as a national shrine, 
                    which houses several first-class relics of the Italian saint, who spent most of his life in a monastery in southern Italy.
                    Known for his stigmata and gift of healing, Padre Pio is one of the most revered saints of the 20th century.
                    In 2018, his heart relic was brought to the shrine where many people trooped to pay homage to the saint.
                    Currently, the Philippines has only one international shrine, which is dedicated to the Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage in Antipolo City. </p>

                <h3>DOT digitizes Bicol tourist arrival for efficient delivery of services</h3>
                <p> LEGAZPI CITY – The Department of Tourism (DOT)-5 (Bicol) is utilizing an electronic record-keeping management tool to digitize 
                    tourist arrivals in the six provinces of the region.</p>
                <p>DOT-5 Regional Director Herbie Aguas said the tourism operations protocol system (TOPS) launched on Monday would help collect and manage accurate, reliable, 
                    prospective and real-time tourist arrival data.
                    "With the implementation of this system, we will be able to produce timely and accurate information on tourism statistics. 
                    The TOPS will also help in the formulation and conceptualization of
                    responsive policies and programs for sustainable tourism development in the region," he said in a follow-up interview on Tuesday.</p>
                <p>Aguas said the TOPS will extract actual visitor arrival data directly from the tourism enterprises.
                    "Once they arrive in the Bicol region and go to a specific tourist destination, they will sign up on the page and the data will be directly submitted to DOT as well as to the local government unit (LGU). Aside from numbers that will be collected,
                     we will also get reviews, we will get impressions of the tourist during their stay," he added.
                    Aguas said Midconcept Solutions, a licensed software company, ensures the rollout and deployment of the TOPS are efficient and accessible to all.</p>
